--TODO--

--0.16--

   *	Requires LibSnert 1.75.8

   !	Configure and build changes to reflect changes in libsnert.

--0.15--

   +	Requires LibSnert 1.70

   !	Conversion from Dns API to PDQ API.

   !	Use updated SPF API from libsnert that employs PDQ.

   !	sample.mc.in: Removed from define(`_FFR_MILTER', `1')dnl

--0.14--

   +	Requires LibSnert 1.65

   +	Added spf-temp-error-dns option that was in the libsnert spf.c
	API, but forgot to add to the option table of the previous
	release.

--0.13--

   !	Disabling of blacklisting in the previous release was too
   	agressive and prevented whitelisting by Connect: tags.
   	Reported by Benji Spencer.

--0.12--

   +	Requires LibSnert 1.63

   !	See LibSnert change log for related DNS and SPF API fixes.

   +	access-db now supports socket-map, flat-file, and SQLite3
	lookups in addition to Berkeley DB. The SQLite3 behaviour
	can be disabled via LibSnert's ./configure script.

   !	Rejection based on access-db blacklisting now disabled. Some
	users prefer leaving blacklisting upto Sendmail and not the
	milter. Reported by Derek Balling and others.

--0.11--

  !!	License 1.4 which provides additional details with regards to
  	possible license controls used, the possibility of "phone
  	home code" and its general contents, and related privacy
  	statement.

   +	Add check for filterOpen() got NULL socket address pointer
	passed to filterOpen() which inidicates an unsupported address
	type. The connection is simply accepted to bypass the milter.

--0.10--

   +	Requires LibSnert 1.61

  !!	Complete replacement of option specification and no backwards.
	compatibility. The newer format allows for better integration
	of previously undocumented libsnert options and for the
	inclusion of future enhancements.

   !	filterClose(): remove reporting of "null workspace error",
	which can occur when a client connection is rejected before or
	by filterOpen().

   !	Minor corrections for gcc -Wall warnings.

--0.9--

   +	Requires LibSnert 1.60

   !	spf.c: Fixed redirect= so that the domain passed to the
	recusive spfCheck() is an independant copy of the macro
	buffer. Reported by Mike Elliott.

   !	spf.c: Fixed handling of ptr mechanism to account for multi-
	homed hosts. Reported by Mike Elliott.

   !	spf.c: Fixed support for dual-cidr-length used for A and MX
   	mechanisms.

   !	spf.c: If a ptr mechanism fails on the forward DNS lookup,
	proceed to the next clause instead of giving an error. More
	fault tolerent of difficult ISPs. Suggested by Mike Elliott.

   +	spf.c: Added spfCheckHeloMailTxt() and -t option for the CLI
	to specify an initial TXT record to start with instead of
	looking up the SPF record of the sender. Suggested by Mike
	Elliott. This can simplify testing.

   +	Added -G option to supply a "best-guess" TXT record in the
   	event the initial test does not yield a Pass for any reason.
   	Requested by Mike Elliott.

	"... If you don't get a pass on the spf record, check the best
	guess record of "v=spf1 a/24 mx/24 ptr", which is command line
	configurable, and see if you get a pass.  If so, pass, else
	report previous result.  Make it optional, off by default ..."

   !	spf.c: Falling off the end of the SPF record that does not
	contain an ``all'' or ``redirect'' clause, failed to set the
	default result correctly to Neutral. Reported by Mike Elliott.

   !	Reverted back to libmilter's default (7210s) timeout. This
	should silence many of the reported sendmail to milter timeout
	errors and/or broken connections caused by the milter timing
	out sooner than sendmail does with the current SMTP client.
	The sendmail defaults for each SMTP command and receiving the
	message content is 1h each and so libmilter allows for 2h 10s.
	But in theory you could be DoS for between 5 and 104 hours per
	connection. If you want to change this then set in
	sendmail.mc:

		define(`confTO_DATABLOCK',      `30m')
		define(`confTO_COMMAND',        `5m')

--0.8--

   +	Requires LibSnert 1.57

   !	If we are only tagging SPF SoftFail or Fail results, then
	ignore TempError results and accept the message. The previous
	behaviour was to reject the message with a 451 response as
	recommended in SPF Internet Draft 2 section 2.5.6.TempError.
	The previous behaviour, while permitted by the SPF draft,
	is too strict, if you choose to only tag messages.

--0.7--

   +	Requires LibSnert 1.56

   !	Changed install.sh.in to create /var/run/mitler/ directory
   	owned by milter:milter and change the default PID_FILE and
   	SOCKET_FILE paths. This provides better privelage/security
   	separation since the milters run as milter:milter.

   !	Removed references to old Socket API, which was never used
	here. milter-spiff uses the Dns client code from LibSnert,
	which uses the regular Unix socket API directly.

--0.6--

   +	Requires LibSnert 1.54

   !	If softfail-tag, fail-tag, softfail-discard, or fail-discard
	are specified and any recipient is white listed, then the
	message is white listed for all recipients of the message. Its
	not possible to tag or discard per recipient. Reported by
	Derek Balling.

   !	spf.c: fix bug in comparison of host name returned from a PTR
	lookup, where the host name will have a trailing root dot, but
	the result of spfMacro(), the evaulated <domain-spec>, doesn't
	and so the test to see if a host name ends with the consulted
	SPF domain failed. Reported by Derek Balling.

   !	Fix invalid pointer reference when adding Received-SPF caused
   	when -S is set and not -R.

--0.5--

   +	Requires LibSnert 1.53

  !!	Fix problems concerning multihomed MX records. Reported by
	Tristan Griffiths.

--0.4--

   +	Requires LibSnert 1.50

  !!	Circular reference bug fixed in spf.c. Reported by Derek
  	Balling.

   +	Added -R and -S options to disable Received-SPF and X-Scanned-
	By headers. Requested by Tanel Kokk.

	Also when both options are set, change the libmilter flags to
	notify sendmail. Can help improve performance when sendmail
	knows there won't be any header additions.

   !	When fail-tag and softfail-tag settings are both not used,
	change the libmilter flags to notify sendmail. Can help
	improve performance when sendmail knows there won't be any
	header changes.

--0.3--

   +	Requires LibSnert 1.48

   !	Recursion and string compare bugs fixed in spf.c.

   !	Fixed milter-spiff-*: tag lookups in access.db.

   !	More debug code.

   !	An invalid HELO, which is a not FQDN, will probably generate
	a "DNS name not found" error and so return SPF_TEMP_ERROR.
	This can happen while many mail clients continue to submit
	email via port 25, instead of the MSA port 587. Consider
	a Windows machine where the mail client uses the machine's
	workgroup name with no Internet domain suffix.

	So when the HELO argument generates an SPF_TEMP_ERROR and
	the DNS error corresponds to not found or undefined result,
	then treat the result as SPF_NONE.

   !	When the MAIL FROM:<> is used, don't white list the bounce
	message, instead use the SPF HELO test result as outlined in
	Meng Weng Wong's Dec 2004 white paper. This prevents spammers
	from simply using the DSN address for all their tripe.

   !	Removed redundant xxfi_data() support with respect to RCPT
   	white listing. Requested by Derek Balling.

--0.2--

   +	Requires LibSnert 1.47

   +	Added support for %{s}, %{l}, %{o}, %{h}, and %{p} macros.
	Requested by Michael Elliott. The only elements now missing
	are the "exp=", the %{c}, %{r}, %{t} macros, and upper case
	URL escape version of the macros.

   !	Changed spf function API to use spfCheckHeloMail() so that
   	we can expand %{h}.

--0.1--

   +	Requires LibSnert 1.46.
